# Arduino DroneCAN

This repository allows easy integration of sensors to be used with Ardupilot and PX4 via DroneCAN. Sensors can be integrated within minutes by using pre-existing Arduino libraries for sensors, and through this library which abstracts the DroneCAN layer so you can focus on sending and receiving messages.

By using the Arduino core and PlatformIO with pre-configured board setups, you can start developing instantly.

This isn't intended to be used in the same way as AP_Periph, which supports tons of sensors all at once and is highly adaptable without writing code. This is intended for writing a DroneCAN interface for any sensor or system, without having to deal with a large code base and lots of boilerplate.

## Currently Supported Hardware

This repository is plug and play with the Beyond Robotix CAN node series!

## Usage

Minimal boilerplate code needed, you can add you sensor messages easily!

See src/main.cpp for a full example, which reads in the built in STM32 MCU temperature sensor and writes this into a Battery messsage. It also reads in magnetometer measurements on the bus and prints them to serial.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <dronecan.h>

static bool shouldAcceptTransfer(const CanardInstance *ins,
                                 uint64_t *out_data_type_signature,
                                 uint16_t data_type_id,
                                 CanardTransferType transfer_type,
                                 uint8_t source_node_id);
static void onTransferReceived(CanardInstance *ins, CanardRxTransfer *transfer);

DroneCAN dronecan;

void setup()
{
    // Do your usual Arduino sensor initialisation here
    dronecan.init(onTransferReceived, shouldAcceptTransfer);
}

void loop()
{
    // Read your sensor data, and compose dronecan messages here
    dronecan.cycle();
}

void onTransferReceived(CanardInstance *ins, CanardRxTransfer *transfer)
{
    // describes what to do with received DroneCAN messages
}

bool shouldAcceptTransfer(const CanardInstance *ins,
                          uint64_t *out_data_type_signature,
                          uint16_t data_type_id,
                          CanardTransferType transfer_type,
                          uint8_t source_node_id)
{
    // can be used to filter what is passed to onTransferReceived
}
```

## Repository structure

This repository is designed to be cloned and run straight away using the example application in ./src/main.cpp

All 3 of the following libraries are required:

- ./lib/arduino_dronecan contains the library which has been written to make dronecan plug and play
- ./lib/dronecan contains the actual dronecan message types generated by dronecan_dsdlc
- ./lib/libcanard contains the canard library which handles parsing of dronecan messages

There is some platformio boilerplate to do to support new boards
- ./boards
- ./variants

The required repos to generate the dronecan messages etc are in ./dronecan, although ./lib already contains the generated files so these are just for reference.

## Dronecan DSDLC

If you want to generate the dronecan message headers from scratch, ensure you have the submodules cloned, then:

> cd dronecan

> python dronecan_dsdlc/dronecan_dsdlc.py -O ../lib/dronecan
