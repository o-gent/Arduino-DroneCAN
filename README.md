# Arduino DroneCAN

This repository allows easy integration of sensors to be used with Ardupilot and PX4 via DroneCAN. Sensors can be integrated within minutes by using pre-existing Arduino libraries for sensors, and through this library which abstracts the DroneCAN layer so you can focus on sending and receiving messages.

By using the Arduino core and PlatformIO with pre-configured board setups, you can start developing instantly.

This isn't intended to be used in the same way as AP_Periph, which supports tons of sensors all at once and is highly adaptable without writing code. This is intended for writing a DroneCAN interface for any sensor or system, without having to deal with a large code base and lots of boilerplate.

## Features

API changes can happen at any time in master. See the releases page to download a specific verison for your project. Once we've solved firmware updates over CAN we'll release a V1 version!

## Currently Supported Hardware

This repository is plug and play with the Beyond Robotix CAN node series!

See [Beyond Robotix Can Node](https://www.beyondrobotix.com/)

Docs for the node hardware [CAN node gitbook](https://beyond-robotix.gitbook.io/docs/can-node-system)

<img src="./assets/BR_CAN_NODE.png" width="50%">

To get started:
1. Install VScode
2. Install the PlatformIO extension
3. Clone/Download this repository
4. Plug in the CAN node via USB or STLINK
5. Click the upload button!
6. The CAN Node will report a simulated battery CAN message to any Ardupilot/PX4/DroneCAN usb !
7. Create your custom CAN application using Arduino libraries.. 

## Code Usage

Minimal boilerplate code needed, you can add you sensor messages easily!

See src/main.cpp for a full example, which reads in the built in STM32 MCU temperature sensor and writes this into a Battery messsage. It also reads in magnetometer measurements on the bus and prints them to serial.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <dronecan.h>

DroneCAN dronecan;

/*
This function is called when we receive a CAN message, and it's accepted by the shouldAcceptTransfer function.
We need to do boiler plate code in here to handle parameter updates and so on, but you can also write code to interact with sent messages here.
*/
static void onTransferReceived(CanardInstance *ins, CanardRxTransfer *transfer)
{

    DroneCANonTransferReceived(dronecan, ins, transfer);
}

/*
For this function, we have to sign the signaure of any messages we want to recieve. We do the boilerplate handling for parameters etc. See main.cpp for an example on how to handle this.
 */
static bool shouldAcceptTransfer(const CanardInstance *ins,
                                 uint64_t *out_data_type_signature,
                                 uint16_t data_type_id,
                                 CanardTransferType transfer_type,
                                 uint8_t source_node_id)

{
    
    return false || DroneCANshoudlAcceptTransfer(ins, out_data_type_signature, data_type_id, transfer_type, source_node_id);
}


void setup()
{
    // Do your usual Arduino sensor initialisation here
    
    dronecan.init(onTransferReceived, shouldAcceptTransfer);
}

void loop()
{
    // Read your sensor data, and compose dronecan messages here

    dronecan.cycle();
}
```

## Repository structure

This repository is designed to be cloned and run straight away using the example application in ./src/main.cpp.

All 3 of the following libraries are required:

- ./lib/arduino_dronecan contains the library which has been written to make dronecan plug and play
- ./lib/dronecan contains the actual dronecan message types generated by dronecan_dsdlc
- ./lib/libcanard contains the canard library which handles parsing of dronecan messages

There is some platformio boilerplate to do to support new boards
- ./boards
- ./variants

The required repos to generate the dronecan messages etc are in ./dronecan, although ./lib already contains the generated files so these are just for reference.
